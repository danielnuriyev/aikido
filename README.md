# Aikido

## Our Style

Whereas in most Aikido schools you will polish techniques in a graceful harmony with your training partner, this is not what happens in a real fight. 

The goal of our training to understand the origin of the techniques, how they can be applied in present day circumstances. 

To do so, 

- we expand our arsenal by techniques from Judo and Jujutsu
- we learn how takedowns can be performed as strikes
- we learn how to spar in a safe Judo like way

and much more

## Instructor

I, Daniel Nuriyev, trained between 2009 - 2022 under Jason DeLucia, student of Takano Kōsaku Sensei. Prior to that between 1992 - 2008 I trained in Changquan Wushu, Traditional Kongfu, Sanda and Taijiquan. In parallel I spent a few years learning and teaching Krav Maga.

And, in the spirit of never stopping to learn, I am trying to learn BJJ and it's not easy ;)
